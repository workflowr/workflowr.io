This iterates through all the taxonomies, which is currently only Topics. If I
had Publications has a taxonomy, it would also be included here, which might not
make as much sense.

  I couldn't figure out how to order this by count. I don't know how to navigate
  from .Site.Taxonomies to .Data.Terms.ByCount, which is what I used in
  terms.html.

  This will currently include every single tag, which could become
  unsustainable. hugo-clarity sets a site parameter to limit the number of terms
  shown.
