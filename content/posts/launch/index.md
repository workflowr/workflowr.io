The R package [workflowr][] helps you make your data analysis projects more
organized, reproducible, and shareable. One limitation has always been
discoverability. Since each [workflowr][] website is hosted from its own individual
repository, they aren't easy to find. So currently the only ways for another
interested researcher to find your analyses is 1\) you send them the URL
directly, 2\) they see the URL in your published paper, or 3\) they happen to
stumble across your GitHub/GitLab profile. I've long wanted to make it easier
for others to discover your reproducible research projects.

Hence I created this site, [workflowr.io][], to be a central location for
curating open science projects created with [workflowr][]. Adding your workflowr
project(s) to this site is quick and convenient: install the [workflowr.io
GitHub App][github-app] on the project(s) you want to share. If you like, you
can further customize the appearance of your project on this site by adding
topics and/or registering an associated publication. Importantly, your GitHub
repository is not affected by installing the app, i.e. it will continue to be
hosted with GitHub Pages. Please see the [documentation][] for the latest
instructions.

If you've already used [workflowr][] for a project, please consider adding to it to
[workflowr.io][]. Analyses of any size are welcome. In other words, don't feel
like you can only add published research projects. Feel free to share your hobby
projects, tutorials, workshops, notes, etc. And please spread the word to other
[workflowr][] users. Thanks!
