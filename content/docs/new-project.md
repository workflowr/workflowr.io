To start using workflowr, the best place to start is to go through the [Getting
started vignette][getting-started]. This will take you from zero to deploying a
website. Once you are comfortable with the basics of the workflowr framework,
you can read through the other [vignettes][]. For example, if you already have
an existing project that you would like to migrate to use workflowr, read
[Migrating an existing project to use workflowr][migrating].
